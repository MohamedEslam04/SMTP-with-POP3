# Simple Email Server

## Overview

This Java application implements a simple email server system, allowing users to register, log in, send emails, and read emails. The system consists of a server (`Server.java`), a client (`Client.java`), and a file manager (`FileManager.java`) for handling user credentials and emails.

## File Structure

### `Client.java`

- The client-side implementation.
- Connects to the server on localhost:5056.
- Communicates with the server to perform actions like registering, logging in, sending emails, and reading emails.

### `ClientHandler.java`

- Manages communication with a specific client on the server side.
- Handles user authorization, registration, login, sending emails, and reading emails.

### `FileManager.java`

- Manages file operations related to user credentials and emails.
- Creates and checks user credentials and emails.
- Saves and reads emails.
- Creates user-specific folders.

### `Server.java`

- Implements the server-side of the application.
- Listens on port 5056 for incoming client connections.
- Creates a new thread (`ClientHandler`) for each client to handle communication independently.

## How to Run

1. **Server Setup:**
    - Run `Server.java` to start the server.
    - The server will be running on localhost:5056.

2. **Client Interaction:**
    - Run `Client.java` to start a client.
    - Follow the prompts to register, log in, send emails, or read emails.
    - Type "quit" to exit the client.

## Dependencies

- This application uses standard Java libraries and does not have external dependencies.

## Notes

- The system uses a simple text file-based approach for managing users and emails.
- Error handling is implemented to catch IO exceptions and print stack traces.
- The server handles multiple clients concurrently using multithreading.

## Security Considerations

- This is a basic implementation for educational purposes and lacks proper security measures.
- In a production environment, ensure the implementation includes encryption, secure user authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
